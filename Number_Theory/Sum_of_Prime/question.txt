Given a number (greater than 2), print two prime numbers whose sum will be equal to given number, else print -1 if no such number exists.

NOTE: A solution will always exist if the number is even. Read Goldbach’s conjecture.

If [a, b] is one solution with a <= b, and [c, d] is another solution with c <= d, and a < c then print [a, b] only
and not all possible solutions.

Input:
The first line contains an integer T, depicting total number of test cases. Then following T lines contains an integer N.

Output:
Print the two prime numbers in a single line with space in between.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 50
2 ≤ N ≤ 1000000

Example:
Input:
2
8
3
Output
3 5
-1

Explanation:
Testcase 1: two prime numbers from 1 to 8 are 3 and 5 whose sum is 8.
